# WHQ - Device Dashboard

Thanks for your interest in WHQ! We'd like to get a better sense of your code,
so we put together a single page spec for a dashboard application.

Please recreate the included PDF in code. The `assets` directory includes the icons and
variables you'll need. Just "Use this template" and then send us an email with a link to your
repo when you want us to review.

Here are some things we'd like you to keep in mind:

- Use the technology you're most comfortable with. We're always evaluating
  the latest technologies and don't have a strong preference for tools.
- Stay close to the mockup, but if you see room to improve the UX, go for it!
  We care more about the structure of your code than pixel-perfection here.
- Follow best practices, whatever that means to you. The more insight you give
  us into your decision making process, the better.
